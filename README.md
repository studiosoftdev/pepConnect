Basic socketed chat application. This meets the minimum requirements for the challenge. I will continue working on it to get multiple users on it but since I'm not sure if I will have the time this week I figured I might as well get this uploaded now and then see if I can update it later on this week with more features.

Enter your username, and type your messages. You will see it appear on the server side, with message sent-time attached. Hopefully it'll do more soon.

Update: Server now accepts multiple clients but messages don't yet display on client's screens.
